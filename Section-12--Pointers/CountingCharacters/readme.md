write a function that calculates the length of a string
* the function should take as a parameter a const char pointer
* the function can only determine the length of the string using pointer arithmatic (use increment operator (++pointer) to get to the of the string)
* your are required to use a while loop using the value of the pointer to exit
* the function should subtract two pointers (one pointing to the end of the string and one pointing to the beginning of the string)
* the function should return an int that is the length of the string passed to the function
