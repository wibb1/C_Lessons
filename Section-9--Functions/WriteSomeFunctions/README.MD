# Write 3 functions in a single program

* ## Write a function which finds the greatest common divisor of two non-negative integer values and returns the result
  * gcd, takes two ints as parameters

* ## Write a function to calculate the absolute value of a number
  * should take a float parameter and return a float
  * test this function with ints and floats

* ## Write a function to compute the square root of a number
  * if a negative argument is passed then a message is displayed and -1.0 should be returned
  * should use the absoluteValue function as implemented in the step above
